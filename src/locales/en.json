    "desc2": " We saw that; pressurized irrigation systems were used in agricultural and landscaping areas, almost as if they were surface irrigation. Preventing this unsustainable waste, pollution and desertification caused by these actions was not possible with current technologies and approaches. Our technologies are developed to put a stop to this trend and it's a golden key that will bring profitability and abundance to your businesses. Our cyber physical technologies, produced with 97.34% domestic and national resources and its environment and user friendly, as can be seen with CE and RoHS certification. Considering that we use 75% of the water resources for irrigation, it is our duty for future generations to protect the diminishing and polluted water resources and soil in the basins where cultivate. With this understanding, I would like to thank you for your interest and I would like to express my happiness at crossing of our paths.",

We can monitor the capillary rise and compare the measures to be taken according to received data. Knowing the groundwater level is necessary to clearly define the drainage problem and to carry out irrigation and fertilization operations without causing pollution and waste. Depending on the ground water level, the moisture rises with the capillarity movement from the ground water to the ground in the soil profile.",
    "desc2": "Soil conditions at saturation that cause the plants to be oxygen-free and dry. So therefore, it requires drainage. In the classical drainage approach, more water is tried to be drained deeper than the root zone of the plant, if not possible, at the level of the effective root zone. After the drainage problem is resolved in parks and gardens or in a field/basin where an agricultural production is made, the irrigation water requirement is given to the plant. In most regions, plants meet their irrigation water needs from the ground water that is drained or not.",
    "desc3": "However, since there is no technology that can determine how much plant water needs can be met from ground water, more than necessary irrigation is also done. With irrigation, the ground water swells well and/or it mixes with the fertilizers and chemicals in the irrigation water. Washing of the nitrogen takes place, resulting in a serious waste of fertilizer and groundwater pollution.",
